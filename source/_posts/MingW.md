## Extensions
Two ectensions are needed, one is C/C++ and the other is C/C++ Compile Run

## Configuration

I use this article [VSCode C/C++ Development Setup for Windows using Chocloatey](https://medium.com/@7sonu44589/vscode-c-c-development-setup-for-windows-run-debug-intellisense-a1aa5d2e9553), and copy configuration from https://github.com/Paras44589/Chocolatey_VS-Code-C-Development-Setup

## Notice

In C, only "" is considered as valid, '' is only for char.
