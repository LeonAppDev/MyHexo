## Advantage
  I first caught this word in a few months ago, someone said it is a benifit for frontend but need backend's effort so it is hard to push it. But I say it will release heavy maintenance pressure for backend end user as well. I will consider it a sliver bullet for api based world. 

  It gives you a what you get is what you want experience.
  It all begins with the conception query, whenever you want to get something, you send a query(root query), a query could be either named or anonymous. and a named query can take a variable as argument, and you could ask for any element inside the query. The only inconvenience is if you want to find an element in a quite deep level, have to search from the root. So I do not recommend to put element to deep level, 3-4 levels are fine.
