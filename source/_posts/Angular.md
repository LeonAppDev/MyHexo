There are exicting updates in front end, Redux release Hook so we could use state in function declared component. And Suspense is next big thing in Redux, it uses cache and a HOC accept a fallback comonent to try to make data fetching component easier to be designed. 

Another thing is performance improved feature willl be introduced in Angular. Tree-shakable component which could not depends on module as a center part to import dependencies, instead component could only import dependencies they really need and this lazy-loading is good for performance.
