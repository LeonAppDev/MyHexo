## Major step

I follow the guide in react offical website, major step is as follow

1. Install Java sdk, python and node.js
2. Install Android studio
3. Install Android SDK
4. Set user variables in environment variables
5. Set Path in environment variables
6. Create Android Virtual Device

I have met one issue, when installing Android Studio, it stunk at install HAXM intel X86 emulator and then whne I try to launch emulator, an error related HAXM happens, I solved the issue using below solution

>  Had the same problem in windows 10, which was solved by disabling Hyper-v and reinstalling HAXM via SDK Manager>SDK Tools>Intel x86 Emulator Accelerator


## Issues when debugging

1. FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.

* Where:
Build file '/home/jose/tmp/react-native-unity-demo/android/app/build.gradle' line: 129

* What went wrong:
A problem occurred evaluating project ':app'.
>Could not get unknown property 'MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE' for SigningConfig_Decorated{name=release, storeFile=null, storePassword=null, keyAlias=null, keyPassword=null, storeType=null, v1SigningEnabled=true, v2SigningEnabled=true} of type com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.SigningConfig.

* I need to generate a signing key for some reason, follow below step and remember generate it using powershell and as administrator 
http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html

 I create a key with both password as test11

 2. A problem occurred evaluating project ':react-native-share'.
> Could not find method goole() for arguments [com.facebook.react:react-native:+] on object of type org.gradle.api.internal.artifacts.dsl.dependencies.DefaultDependencyHandler

SOLUTION: I follow this guide of a similar problem with the maps plugin of react.(Link to guide)[https://itnext.io/install-react-native-maps-with-gradle-3-on-android-44f91a70a395]

the following steps are the ones that work for me:

* Modify android/build.gradle

Add google() inside repositories

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        // add google() here
        google()
* Update com.android.tools.build.gradle to 3.1.0

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        google()
    }
    dependencies {
      // classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:2.2.3'
      // update from 2.2.3 to 3.1.0 
      classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.0'
* Add google() inside repositories after dependencies

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
        google()
    }
    dependencies {
      classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.0'
    }
    allprojects {
      repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        jcenter()
        // add googgle() here
        google()
* Add android.enableAapt2=false to android/gradle.properties

android.enableAapt2=false // < ---  add here
android.useDeprecatedNdk=true
* Update gradle version in android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties

// from version 2.14.1
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-2.14.1-all.zip
// change to 4.4
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.4-all.zip
* Run react-native run-android. (This might take a while since itâ€™ll be downloading the updated gradle version).

3. Execution failed for task ':app:preDebugBuild'. > Android dependency 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7' has different version for the compile (27.1.1) and runtime (28.0.0) classpath. You should manually set the same version via DependencyResolution

I solved by adding
subprojects {
    project.configurations.all {
        resolutionStrategy.eachDependency { details ->
            if (details.requested.group == 'com.android.support'
                    && !details.requested.name.contains('multidex') ) {
                details.useVersion "27.1.1"
            }
        }
    }

 4. No resource found that matches the given name: attr 'android:keyboardNavigationCluster'. 
 

Since I change the useVerison to 27.1.1, then I need to change that in android/app/build.gradle as well
 compileSdkVersion 27
 buildToolsVersion "27.0.3"

 5. error: bundling: UnableToResolveError: Unable to resolve module `rn-fetch-blob` from `C:\PrivateAppDev\React-native\GitterMobile\node_modules\react-native-img-cache\build\index.js`: Module does not exist in the module map or in these directories:
  C:\PrivateAppDev\React-native\GitterMobile\node_modules

This might be related to https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/4968
To resolve try the following:
  1. Clear watchman watches: `watchman watch-del-all`.
  2. Delete the `node_modules` folder: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`.
  3. Reset packager cache: `rm -fr $TMPDIR/react-*` or `npm start -- --reset-cache`.

## install React Native Elements

React Native Elements and Native Base are two good material ui library for react native, I installed both of them and meet issues on both

### React Native Elements

Issue for RNE is caused by react-native-vector-icon, since it needs to add reference in Android(Maybe in ios as well) configuration file, and when you use the easiest way, react-native link,  the route for react-native-vector-icon may be wrong, and I solve the issue by using below manually method (reference)[https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#android] 

```
Option: Manually
Copy the contents in the Fonts folder to android/app/src/main/assets/fonts (note lowercase font folder).
Integrating library for getImageSource and ToolbarAndroid support
These steps are optional and only needed if you want to use the Icon.getImageSource function or using custom icons in the Icon.ToolbarAndroid component.

Edit android/settings.gradle to look like this (without the +):

rootProject.name = 'MyApp'

include ':app'

+ include ':react-native-vector-icons'
+ project(':react-native-vector-icons').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/android')
Edit android/app/build.gradle (note: app folder) to look like this:

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
  ...
}

dependencies {
  compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
  compile "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1"
  compile "com.facebook.react:react-native:+"  // From node_modules
+ compile project(':react-native-vector-icons')
}
Edit your MainApplication.java (deep in android/app/src/main/java/...) to look like this (note two places to edit):

package com.myapp;

+ import com.oblador.vectoricons.VectorIconsPackage;

....

  @Override
  protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
      new MainReactPackage()
+   , new VectorIconsPackage()
    );
  }

}
Note: If you're using React Native (Android) <= 0.17, follow this instructions
```

### Native Base

I use a scaffold provied by native base to create a boilter, but meet below issue
Error: Failed to crunch file

It seems quite simple and people suggest 

```
From what I understood, Failed to crunch file means studio can't process the file. This error usually occurs when you hit Maximum File Path Length Limitation(240 characters) of Windows OS.

I would suggest moving your project into upper directory (like D:\barcode-reader).
```

And typescript for react-native is not well supported by current lib, it is better to avoid use it now.
